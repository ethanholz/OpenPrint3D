# OpenPrint3D Governance & Decision Policy

OpenPrint3D is an open-source, community-driven project. Its long-term success depends on transparent collaboration, clear responsibilities, and respectful interaction. This document establishes the project’s governance model and defines how decisions are made, how contributors may become maintainers, and how community spaces are used.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles

OpenPrint3D is founded on the following core principles:

- **Transparency** — All project-affecting decisions must be publicly visible and documented.
- **Neutrality** — No single company, vendor, or individual should dominate the project.
- **Inclusivity** — Contributors of all skill levels are welcome. Respectful collaboration is required.
- **Stability** — APIs, schemas, and standards evolve through structured proposals, not unilateral changes.
- **Openness** — The community is encouraged to discuss ideas openly and participate in shaping the direction of the project.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors
Anyone who submits issues, pull requests, documentation, or constructive feedback is considered a contributor. Contributors do not require special permissions.

### Provisional Maintainers
Provisional Maintainers are contributors who have shown initiative, understanding of the project’s direction, and a willingness to help guide its development. Provisional Maintainers may be granted elevated permissions (e.g., PR review, issue triage) at the discretion of the Project Lead.

Provisional status is intended to:
- Onboard new maintainers,
- Evaluate long-term fit,
- Spread workload without granting full authority immediately.

### Maintainers
Maintainers are trusted, long-term contributors who have demonstrated consistent participation, sound judgment, and strong alignment with the project’s values.

Maintainers:
- Review and merge PRs,
- Participate in technical discussions,
- Help define and steer the roadmap,
- Uphold the Code of Conduct.

Promotion from Provisional Maintainer to Maintainer is determined by the Project Lead, with input from existing maintainers.

### Project Lead
The Project Lead provides final oversight, ensures long-term project vision, and resolves disputes when consensus cannot be reached. The Project Lead may delegate responsibilities, add or remove maintainers, and make binding decisions when necessary for project stability.

---

## 3. Decision Making

### Consensus First
Most decisions should be made through discussion and rough consensus among maintainers.

### When Consensus Cannot Be Reached
If maintainers cannot agree after good-faith discussion:
- The matter is escalated to the Project Lead.
- The Project Lead makes the final decision.
- The decision is documented publicly (e.g., in an issue or RFC).

### Changes to Governance
Modifications to this GOVERNANCE.md must:
- Be proposed via a GitHub issue and/or pull request, and
- Be approved by the Project Lead after community review.

## 4. Communication Channels

To ensure transparency, continuity, and equal access, **GitHub is the authoritative communication platform for OpenPrint3D**.

### 4.1 Authoritative Communication
All official project communication, including:
- Governance discussions  
- Technical proposals  
- Issues and bug reports  
- Pull requests  
- RFCs  
- Project decisions  
- Documentation updates  

**must occur on GitHub**.

GitHub serves as the **source of truth** because it provides:
- Public visibility  
- Permanent history  
- Searchability  
- Archival integrity  
- Clear decision trails  

No decision that affects the project may be finalized exclusively through Discord, private messages, or any other platform.

### 4.2 Community Spaces (Discord, etc.)
Discord and other real-time platforms are **valuable community tools**, and may be used for:
- Informal conversation  
- Support channels  
- Maintainer coordination  
- Live discussions  
- Community events or office hours  
- Early brainstorming  

However:

**Discord is not an authoritative venue for project decisions.**  
Any idea, proposal, consensus, or discussion originating on Discord must be formally moved to GitHub (issue, PR, or RFC) before it becomes part of the project’s record.

This ensures:
- Fair participation for those not on Discord  
- Long-term preservation of decisions  
- Organizational neutrality  
- Clear governance audit trails  

Discord may host GitHub webhooks or announcements only after maintainers reach consensus and confirm that such integrations do **not** shift authoritative communications away from GitHub.

Personal or non-technical disagreements are not valid blocking reasons.

## 5. Code of Conduct

All contributors, maintainers, and community members must adhere to the OpenPrint3D Code of Conduct.  
This includes:

- Treating others with respect  
- Engaging constructively  
- Avoiding harassment or discrimination  
- Refraining from public call-outs or attacks (individuals or organizations)

Any violations will be addressed by the Project Lead and maintainers in accordance with the Code of Conduct document.

---

## 6. Resolving Disputes

For interpersonal or technical disputes:
1. Attempt resolution in the appropriate GitHub discussion thread.  
2. If unresolved, maintainers may request mediation from another maintainer or the Project Lead.  
3. If still unresolved, the Project Lead makes the final determination.

---

## 7. Becoming a Maintainer

A contributor may be invited to become a Provisional Maintainer when they:
- Demonstrate consistent, high-quality contributions  
- Understand the project’s goals and architecture  
- Communicate respectfully  
- Participate in discussions constructively  

They may become a full Maintainer when they:
- Provide steady, thoughtful participation  
- Demonstrate alignment with the project’s values  
- Show sound technical judgment  
- Maintain reliability over time  

The Project Lead makes the final determination.

---

## 8. Leaving or Changing Roles

Contributors and maintainers may step down at any time.

The Project Lead may revoke maintainer status if:
- A maintainer becomes inactive for an extended period  
- Repeatedly violates project norms or governance  
- Acts in a manner harmful to the project  

Role changes are documented publicly on GitHub.

---

## 9. Project Infrastructure

Any infrastructure intended to serve as an **official project resource** (Discord integrations, websites, registries, documentation systems, automation, etc.) must be:

- Proposed and discussed on GitHub  
- Approved by the Project Lead  
- Transferable to the project if the original creator departs  
- Documented in the repository  

This prevents fragmentation and ensures long-term sustainability.

---

## 10. Final Notes

OpenPrint3D is built by the community, for the community. This governance model is intentionally lightweight at the early stage but provides enough structure to prevent instability and ensure long-term openness, transparency, and neutrality.

As the project grows, this document may evolve through community proposals and pull requests.
